# LLMCoder

![](images/LLMCoder.png)

## Purpose

LLMCoder is a tool designed to streamline the process of code modification using Large Language Models (LLMs), especially for Claude. It allows you to:

1. Paste your source code and generate line-numbered versions.
2. Use a custom Markdown diff format to guide LLMs in generating code modifications.
3. Apply the changes to your source code automatically, eliminating the need for manual application.

## Origin

LLMCoder was inspired by [hannesrudolph/llm-code-helper](https://github.com/hannesrudolph/llm-code-helper). The original Python code was converted to pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript with the assistance of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, using a single prompt. This conversion allows for easier usage without the need for Python installation.

## Features

- Auto-focus on input areas
- Automatic formatting of code and processing of changes after pasting
- Auto-clearing of input fields
- Full-page layout without scroll bars for improved user experience
- Markdown format for diffs, which:
  - Saves tokens compared to JSON
  - Avoids escape character problems (e.g., forgetting to use \\" in JSON)
  - Improves readability of diff output
  - Enhances manual correction capabilities
- Additional
  - Utilize Claude Artifact
  - Multiple files (conversion not supported yet) with timestamp
  - Syntax highlighting

Read the [instructions/markdown.instruction.en.md](instructions/markdown.instruction.en.md) to understand the detail of Markdown diff.

## Markdown diff sample

> # file1.css 2024-08-14 08:20:42
> 
> **InsertBetween**
> * From: `13. h1 {`
> * To: `14. }`
> ````css
>   color: var(--primary-color);
>   font-size: 1.5rem;
> ````
> 
> **Remove**
> * From: `26.   display: flex;`
> * To: `26.   display: flex;`
> 
> # file2.js 2024-08-15 18:04:05
> 
> **Replace**
> * From: `12.     function old_function() {`
> * To: `14.     return value;`
> ````js
>     function new_function() {
>       var result = 'New function'
> 
>       return result;
> ````

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser. No Python or additional installation is required.

  Alternatively, you can use the online version: [LLM Coder](https://christorng.github.io/LLMCoder/). It runs entirely in your browser, and no data is sent to any server.

### Integration with Claude

1. Set Claude's Project custom instructions with the content of [instructions/markdown.instruction.en.md](instructions/markdown.instruction.en.md) after your own specific instructions.
2. Ask Claude to modify code. It should follow the instructions and output a Markdown diff.

### Using LLMCoder

1. On the LLMCoder page, paste your source code.
2. Paste the Markdown diff generated by Claude.
3. LLMCoder will automatically apply the changes to the source and copy the result to your clipboard.
4. Paste the modified code back into your IDE to update the source.

## Violentmonkey Userscript

To use LLMCoder as a Violentmonkey userscript, follow these steps:

1. Install the Violentmonkey extension for your browser.
2. Create a new userscript in Violentmonkey.
3. Copy the content of `index.html` and `index.js` into the userscript.
4. Save the userscript and enable it.

The userscript will now run automatically on the specified websites, allowing you to use LLMCoder's features directly in your browser.

## Using the Script to Interact with Claude.ai

1. Open the Claude.ai chat website.
2. Use the Violentmonkey userscript to paste the code with line numbers and the prompt into the chat window.
3. The script will automatically extract the changes made by Claude.ai from the chat and apply them to your code.
4. Copy the modified code from the chat and paste it back into your IDE to update the source.

## Future Plans

This repository is planned to be integrated into [LLMCoderSync](https://github.com/ChrisTorng/LLMCoderSync). You can use them together now. For more information, please refer to the README.md of [LLMCoderSync](https://github.com/ChrisTorng/LLMCoderSync).

## Roadmap

A new `roadmap.md` file has been created to outline the steps and progress of the project. This file includes sections for completed tasks, ongoing tasks, and future tasks. The purpose of the roadmap is to provide a clear and organized view of the project's development and future plans.

## Updated Usage Instructions

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser. No Python or additional installation is required.
3. Refer to the `roadmap.md` file for the project's progress and future plans.

  Alternatively, you can use the online version: [LLM Coder](https://christorng.github.io/LLMCoder/). It runs entirely in your browser, and no data is sent to any server.
